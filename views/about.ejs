      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto;">
        ComplyBot.net is a mission-driven startup based in Michigan, built to help small business owners protect their websites 
        and serve every visitor equally — including those with disabilities.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 1rem auto;">
        After learning firsthand how expensive and confusing accessibility compliance can be, we set out to build a tool that 
        makes it easy, affordable, and fast to stay on the right side of the law — and do the right thing.

      <h2>Why We Care</h2>
      <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 0 auto;">
        Over 1 billion people around the world live with a disability. Many rely on assistive technologies like screen readers, 
        keyboard navigation, or captions to interact with the web. Sadly, most websites still block or ignore them.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 750px; margin: 1rem auto;">
        We believe web access is a civil right. ComplyBot helps eliminate the barriers — and helps businesses avoid costly 
        lawsuits, bad press, and lost customers.
